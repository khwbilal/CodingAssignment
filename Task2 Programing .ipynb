    "Intially as instructed we have used the sample mean imputation method but this method have one of the drawback that is when the number of missing values are very larger in the data set than replacing all those missing data with the same values leads to change in the shape of distribution and hence the standard deviation become smaller when compared before and after imputation. In this step we have chosen KNN imputation technique which works well on such type of data set where there are lot of missing data. KNN imputation fill up the missing values by copying the values from similar records in the same data set the similarity of the two attributes is determined using a distance function generally eucladiean distance is used. the drawback of such technique is that it is time consuming and takes longer time when dealing with large data set. Furthermore the selection of value of k is crucial to performance. In below step we have applied KNN imputation with k = 10. The prediciton results are compared after applying the regression model on both mean imputed data set and KNN imputed data sets in the following steps. \n",
